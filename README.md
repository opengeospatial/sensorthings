= OGC SensorThings API Extension: WebSub WebSub Asynchronous Messaging

STA-WebSub - SensorThings API extension WebSub Asynchronous Messaging - defines an additional SensorThings API capability which allows the distribution of updates via HTTP(S) using Webhook as defined in the W3C WebSub Recommendation. 

A subscriber can fetch base data from a SensorThings API service and then use the same identical URL to subscribe for updates. This avoids the need for any subscriber to poll a SensorThings API service, as any updates - according to the URL used - get submitted to the subscriber's Webhook when the update event is triggered. The use of this WebSub extension is also easy to integrate into existing systems, as producers only need to setup a W3C WebSub compliant Hub that listens to subscription updates via MQTT. Consumers only need to setup a WebSub Subscriber to receive updates via WebHook. The SensorThings API MQTT protocol does not need to be exposed to the subscriber; it can remain internal between the SensorThings API service and the associated STA-WebSub Hub(s). Any SensorThings API service that extends the MQTT topic pattern to include filter and expand capabilities via ODATA query parameters, allows to subscribe for updates by defining actual triggering conditions using `$filter`. Using the ODATA query parameter `$select` and `$expand` also supports the subscriber to get exactly the data and structure as it is fit for purpose. 

The use of STA-WebSub improves the flexible use a SensorThings API service for building asynchronous workflows. The ability to define trigger conditions and to specify the event data structure that is pushed over HTTP(S) POST enables a fit-for-purpose processing of events using workflows. Access control can be implemented in the discovery functionality which controls the subscription based on business or access control policies.
