|===


**In SensorThings control information is represented as annotations whose names start with iot followed by a dot ( . ). Annotations are name/value pairs that have a dot ( . ) as part of the name.**

When annotating a name/value pair for which the value is represented as a JSON object, each annotation is placed within the object and represented as a single name/value pair. In SensorThings the name always starts with the “at” sign (@), followed by the namespace iot, followed by a dot (.), followed by the name of the term (e.g., **"@iot.id":**1).

When annotating a name/value pair for which the value is represented as a JSON array or primitive value, each annotation that applies to this name/value pair is placed next to the annotated name/value pair and represented as a single name/value pair. The name is the same as the name of the name/value pair being annotated, followed by the “at” sign (**@**), followed by the namespace iot, followed by a dot (.), followed by the name of the term.  (e.g., `+"Locations@iot.navigationLink":"http://example.org/v.1.0/Things(1)/Locations"+`)

The Location entity locates the Thing or the Things it associated with. A Thing’s Location entity is defined as the last known location of the Thing.


A Thing’s Location may be identical to the Thing’s Observations’ FeatureOfInterest. In the context of the IoT, the principle location of interest is usually associated with the location of the Thing, especially for __in-situ__ sensing applications. For example, the location of interest of a wifi-connected thermostat should be the building or the room in which the smart thermostat is located. And the FeatureOfInterest of the Observations made by the thermostat (e.g., room temperature readings) should also be the building or the room. In this case, the content of the smart thermostat’s location should be the same as the content of the temperature readings’ feature of interest.


However, the ultimate location of interest of a Thing is not always the location of the Thing (e.g., in the case of remote sensing). In those use cases, the content of a Thing’s Location is different from the content of the FeatureOfInterest of the Thing’s Observations. Section 7.1.4 of [OGC 10-004r3 and ISO 19156:2011] provides a detailed explanation of observation location.

A thing can be geo-referenced in different spaces. For example, for some applications it is more suitable to use a topological space model (e.g., IndoorGML) to describe an indoor things’ location rather than using a geometric space model (e.g., GeoJSON). Currently GeoJSON is the only Location encodingType of the SensorThings API. In the future we expect to extend SensorThings API’s capabilities by adding additional encodingType to the code values listed in the above table. For example, one potential new Location encodingType can be a JSON encoding for IndoorGML.

The Sensor encodingType allows clients to know how to interpret metadata’s value. Currently SensorThings API defines two common Sensor metadata encodingTypes. Most sensor manufacturers provide their sensor datasheets in a PDF format. As a result, PDF is a Sensor encodingType supported by SensorThings API. The second Sensor encodingType is SensorML.

An Observation results in a value being assigned to a phenomenon. The phenomenon is a property of a feature, the latter being the FeatureOfInterest of the Observation [OGC and ISO 19156:2011]. In the context of the Internet of Things, many Observations’ FeatureOfInterest can be the Location of the Thing. For example, the FeatureOfInterest of a wifi-connect thermostat can be the Location of the thermostat (__i.e.__, the living room where the thermostat is located in). In the case of remote sensing, the FeatureOfInterest can be the geographical area or volume that is being sensed.
