== SensorThings Sensing MQTT Extension

In addition to support HTTP protocol, a SensorThings service MAY support MQTT protocol to enhance the SensorThings service publish and subscribe capabilities.
This section describes the SensorThings MQTT extension.
To help a client find the MQTT endpoints of a SensorThings service, the endpoints of the service are documented in the `+serverSettings+` object of the landing page described in <<usage-no-resource-path>>.
If the service supports the MQTT extension, then the `+serverSettings+` object SHALL contain properties of type Object, with the names

http://www.opengis.net/spec/iot_sensing/1.0/req/create-observations-via-mqtt/observations-creation
----

These Objects SHALL contain a property named `+endpoints+` of type Array.
The JSON Array `+endpoints+` SHALL hold a list of URL Schemes that can be used to connect to the MQTT service, as seen in example 10 in <<usage-no-resource-path>>.
If the service supports both update-notification and observation-creation over MQTT, it may use different endpoints for the two services.

SensorThings MQTT extension provides the capability of creating Observation entity using MQTT protocol. To create an Observation entity in MQTT, the client sends a MQTT Publish request to the SensorThings service and the MQTT topic is the Observations resource path. The MQTT application message contains a single valid Observation entity representation. <<fig-mqtt-create>> contains the sequence diagram for creating Observation using MQTT publish as well as MQTT sending notifications for Observation creation.

If the MQTT topic for the Observation is a navigationLink from Datastream or FeatureOfInterest, the new Observation entity is automatically linked to that Datastream or FeatureOfInterest respectively.

Similar to creating Observations with HTTP POST, creating Observations with MQTT Publish follow the integrity constraints for creating Observation listed in <<tab-integrity-creating-entity>>. The two special cases defined in Req 33 are also applied in the case of creating Observations with MQTT Publish.


[[mqtt-link-existing-entities-creating]]
==== Link to existing entities when creating an Observation entity

To link to existing entities when creating an Observation entity with MQTT, the conditions in Req 34 is applied.


[[mqtt-deep-insert]]
==== Create related entities when creating an Observation entity (deep insert)

To create related entities when creating an entity with MQTT, the condition in Req 35 is applied.

To receive notifications from a SensorThings service when some entities updated, a client can send a MQTT Subscribe request to the SensorThings service. SensorThings API defined the following four MQTT subscription use cases. <<fig-mqtt-update>> contains the sequence diagram of receiving updates using MQTT Subscribe.

[[mqtt-subscribe-entity-set]]
==== Receive updates of a SensorThings entity set with MQTT Subscribe

**MQTT Control Packet:** Subscribe

**Topic Pattern:** RESOURCE_PATH/COLLECTION_NAME

**Example Topic:** Datastreams(1)/Observations

**Response:** When a new entity is added to the entity set (e.g., a new Observation created) or an existing entity of the entity set is updated, the service returns a complete JSON representation of the newly created or updated entity.


[[mqtt-entity-updates]]
==== Receive updates of a SensorThings entity with MQTT Subscribe

**MQTT Control Packet:** Subscribe

**Topic Pattern:** RESOURCE_PATH_TO_AN_ENTITY

**Example Topic:** Datastreams(1)

**Response:**When a property of the subscribed entity is updated, the service returns a complete JSON representation of the updated entity.


[[mqtt-subscribe-entity-property]]
==== Receive updates of a SensorThings entity’s property with MQTT Subscribe

**MQTT Control Packet:** Subscribe

**Topic Pattern:** RESOURCE_PATH_TO_AN_ENTITY/PROPERTY_NAME

**Example Topic:** Datastreams(1)/observedArea

**Response:** When the value of the subscribed property is changed, the service returns a JSON object. The returned JSON object follows as defined in <<usage-address-property-of-entity>>.

**Example {counter:examples}: an example response of receiving updates of an entity’s property with MQTT Subscribe.** The example shows a sample response of the following MQTT topic subscription: Datastreams(1)/description


[source,json]
----
{
  "description": "This is an updated description of a thing"
}
----


[[mqtt-subscribe-select]]
==== Receive updates of the selected properties of the newly created entities or updated entities of a SensorThings entity set with MQTT Subscribe

**MQTT Control Packet:** Subscribe

**Topic Pattern:** RESOURCE_PATH/COLLECTION_NAME?$select=PROPERTY_1,PROPERTY_2,…

**Response:** When a new entity is added to an entity set or an existing entity is updated (e.g., a new Observation created or an existing Observation is updated), the service returns a JSON representation of the selected properties of the newly created or updated entity.

Note: In the case of an entity’s property is updated, it is possible that the selected properties are not the updated property, so that the returned JSON does not reflect the update.

**Example {counter:examples}: an example response of receiving updates of the selected property of an entity set with MQTT Subscribe.**
The example shows a sample response of the following MQTT topic subscription: Datastreams(1)/Observations?$select=phenomenonTime,result
