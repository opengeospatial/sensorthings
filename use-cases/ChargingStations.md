# Smart City Charging Stations

**Contributed by:** HylkeVDS - Fraunhofer IOSB

## Typical user scenario:

A city has many different sensors on-line. One sensor type measures the
availability of charging stations for electic vehicles. A user looking for a
parking spot with charging capabilities would like to find a suitable spot
near his destination, and if none are available, set a subscription so that
he is notified when a spot becomes available in the geospatial area near his
destination.

* In v1.1 the user needs to set an individual subscription for each Datastream
  (parking spot) in the area he is interested in.
