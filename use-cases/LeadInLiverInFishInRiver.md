# Lead in Liver in Fish in River

**Contributed by:** hylkevds - Fraunhofer IOSB

## Typical user scenario:

The water quality in a water body is monitored. Water samples are taken regularly and analysed.
 
- Some pollutants are measured directly in the water.
- Some pollutants are measured in the sediments after centrifugation/filtration
- Some pollutants are measured in certain organs of certain fish-spiecies living in the water body.

The tricky thing is how to model ObservedProperty, Thing and FeatureOfInterest.

Ways to model:
* A long list of complex ObservedProperties
  * Lead in Liver of Cod
  * Lead in Kidney of Cod
  * Lead in Liver of Salmon (same Salmon, where to put that?)
  * Lead in Kidney of Salmon (same Salmon, where to put that?)
  Leads to many OPs
* ObservableProperty (A model behind ObservedProperty)
  * Same number of ObservedProperties
  * Better filtering options for clients that understand the model
* Samples in O&M V3
  * Sample 1: Cod-42
    * Sub-Sample: Liver
      * Observation ObservedProperty: Lead
    * Sub-Sample: Kidney
      * Observation ObservedProperty: Lead
