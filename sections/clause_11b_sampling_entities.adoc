=== Sampling Entities

The sampling extension adds entity types, properties and relations needed to precicely describe the way samples are taken.

The entity types, properties and relations added by this extension are depicted in <<img-sta-sampling-relations>>.

A Sample is a small part or fraction of a larger Feature.
The Sample is used as a proxy for the larger Feature because Observations can not be made directly on the Feature itself.
The act of taking a Sample is called a Sampling.
The Sample is made by a Sampler, following a certain SamplingProcedure, though the Sampler and SamplingProcedure may not always be known and are thus optional.

Example: A small water sample is taken at a certain location in a river.
The water sample is packaged and send to a laboratory for analysis.


==== Requirement Class: Sampler

The Sampler describes the machine, device, human or other entity that executed the sampling procedure to produce a sample.

==== Requirement Class: PreparationProcedure

After a sample is taken, a preparation procedure can be applied to it.
For example, a specimen of butterfly species is treated with chemicals to preserve it, or a fish is frozen for long-term storage.
The difference with the sampling procedure is that the preparation procedure does not result in one or more new samples, but that an existing sample is modified.
The PreparationProcedure stores the generic procedure that can be applied to many samples.
The PreparationSteps can be instantiated separately for each Sample and can store operational details, such as the exact amouts of chemicals used.

==== Requirement Class: PreparationStep

When applying a PreparationProcdedure to a Sample, the process is recorded in individual PreparationSteps.
For a simple, short PreparationProcedure, a single PreparationStep can be sufficient to record the fact that the preparation procedure was applied to the Sample, and the time at which the procedure was applied.
For a complex procedure, that takes a long time, many PreparationSteps may be recorded.
