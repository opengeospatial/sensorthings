== The OGC SensorThings API Core Data Model

=== Introduction

The core data model of the STA Standard is based on the OGC/ISO Observation, Measurements and Samples (OMS) model (<<OgcOMS>> and <<IsoOMS>>).
An Observation is modeled as an act that produces a result whose value is an estimate of a property of a given Feature.
An Observation instance is characterized by its event time (e.g., resultTime and phenonmenonTime), Feature, ObservedProperty, and the observer that made the Observation (often a Sensor).

The STA Standard also models Things.
A Thing draws from the same concept as a Host in OMS where a Host is defined as a collection of Observers (defined as Sensor in the STA Standard).
Formally, its definition follows the ITU-T definition:
“__an object of the physical world (physical things) or the information world (virtual things) that is capable of being identified and integrated into communication networks__” <<ITU-T-Y.2060>>.

The geographical Locations of Things are useful in almost every application and as a result are included as well.
For the Things whose location changed, the HistoricalLocations entities offer the history of the Thing's locations.

A Thing also can have multiple Datastreams.
A Datastream is a collection of Observations grouped by the same ObservedProperty, Sensor and optionally by Feature and ObservingProcedure.

An Observation is an event performed by a Sensor that produces a result whose value is an estimate of an ObservedProperty of any given Feature which may be a proximate or ultimate feature of interest.
Details of each above described entity are provided in the sections below.

All data model requirements are grouped in the following requirements class:

In this section, each entity depicted in <<img-sta-core>> and its relationships with other entities is defined.
Additionally, examples of modelling the entities in different contexts are provided.


=== Recurring attributes

Several attributes are used in several classes.
They always have the same semantic meaning, regardless of the class they are used in.

`id`:: The primary key of the class.
  An Entity is uniquely identified, among Entities of the same class and in the same service, by its `id` value.
  The data type of the `id` attribute may vary between services, or even between classes in the same service, but must be the same for all Entities of the same class in the same service.
  In most cases the value of the `id` attribute of an Entity will be generated by the service when the Entity is created, but a service may allow users to specify a value.

`name`:: The name of an Entity is a (short) character string that describes the Entity.
  It does not need to be unique among entities of the same type, though, when two entities of the same type have the same name, there should be another distinguishing attribute.
  Two Things with the same name are likely to cause confusion, but two Datastreams with the same name are generally acceptable, as long as these Datastreams are associated to different Things.

`description`:: The description of an Entity is a longer, human readable, character string giving a descriptive text of the Entity.

`definition`:: The definition of an Entity is a unique external identifier, linking the Entity to an external, authoritative source.
  The definition enables different services to represent different aspects of the same systems.
  It can, for instance, be a URL to a feature in an OGC API - Features service, or a DID pointing to a cryptographically signed resource.

`properties`:: A set of user-defined named values.
  The values may be of any type, including nested arrays or name-value sets.
  In the default JSON encoding the `properties` attribute is a JSON-Object.

The OGC SensorThings API Standard follows the ITU-T definition with regard to the Internet of Things: A thing is an object of the physical world (physical things) or the information world (virtual things) that is capable of being identified and integrated into communication networks <<ITU-T-Y.2060>>.
A Thing is related to the Platform entity as described in Section 4.9.2.1 of <<ogc16-079>> in a way that any entity that can be modelled as a Thing may be subsequently translated to a Platform and vice versa.

Examples of the use of Thing are:

- A weather station that houses a varying set of environmental sensors;
- A thermostat in a room, monitoring and controlling the temperature on that room;
- A drone that mounts a LiDAR sensor for mapping purposes;
- A science vessel that has many sensors installed;
- An upstream oil well that is equipped with compound gas detection devices.

The Location entity geo-locates the Thing or the Things it associated with.
A Thing's Location entity is defined as the last known location of the Thing.

Section 7.1.4 of [<<OgcOMS>> and <<IsoOMS>>] provides a detailed explanation of observation location.
Examples of the use of Location are:

- An air quality sensing facility's Location can be the physical location where the facility is situated, but the (proximate) Feature that is characterized by the Observation could be the air envelope around the Sensor which is subsequently used to estimate the air quality of the district where the facility is situated.

- A drone that mounts a LiDAR Sensor may have its Location as the geo-referenced area over which the drone is scheduled to fly, whereas the Feature could be the individual objects mapped by the Sensor within that geo-referenced area

[requirement]
.Class HistoricalLocation
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: {identifier}/req/datamodel/core/historical-location

part:: Each HistoricalLocation entity shall have the mandatory attributes and may have the optional attributes listed in <<historical-location-attributes>>.

part:: Each HistoricalLocation entity shall have the direct relation between a HistoricalLocation entity and other entity types listed in <<historical-location-relations>>.

part:: When the Locations relation of a Thing changes, a new HistoricalLocation shall be created and added to the Thing automatically by the service.
The current Location(s) of the Thing shall only be added to this autogenerated HistoricalLocation automatically by the service, and shall not be created as HistoricalLocation directly by user.

part:: When a user directly adds new HistoricalLocation, and the time of this new HistoricalLocation is later than the latest HistoricalLocation for the Thing, then the Locations of the Thing are changed to the Locations of this new HistoricalLocation.
====



A Thing's HistoricalLocation entity set provides the times of the current (i.e., last known) and previous locations of the Thing.
It can be used to model the path observed by a moving Thing.
An example of the use of HistoricalLocation is:

- A drone that measures methane leaks over a large basin may want to record the trajectory through which it flies.
HistoricalLocation should then record the individual Locations of the drone over time.


The HistoricalLocation can also be created, updated and deleted.
A use case is to migrate historical observation data from an existing observation data management system to an OGC SensorThings API enabled system.
Another use case is to track the Location of a Thing when a permanent network connection is not available.
If the Location of a Thing is changed at a later time, when a network connection is available again, then the auto-generated Time of the HistoricalLocation entity would not reflect the time when the Thing was actually at the set Location, but only the time at which the change was sent to the server.
To resolve this, the Location of a Thing can also be changed by adding a HistoricalLocation.
If the time of a manually created HistoricalLocation is later than the time of all existing HistoricalLocations, then the Location of the Thing is updated to the Location of this manually created HistoricalLocation.

part:: The service shall ensure the linked ObservedProperties match the definitions used in the `resultType`.
====


A Datastream groups a collection of Observations into a time series measuring the same ObservedProperties by the same Sensor for the same Thing.
Examples of Datastreams could be:

- An air quality monitoring station may have multiple Datastreams, each recording a specific pollutant measured by a specific sensor.
- A sensor that measures multiple ObservedProperties can generate a single Datastream with a composite resultType.

A Datastream can both have a proximate feature of interest and one or more ultimate features of interest.
An ultimate feature of interest is the broadest domain feature that the Observations in the Datastream can be said to represent.
The proximate feature of interest is the object on which a measurement is taken as representative of the ultimate feature of interest.
An individual Observation can also have a proximate feature of interest, which would, in most cases, be a sample with a limited set of Observations taken on it.

For example, in water quality the ultimate feature of interest could be a river, while the proximate feature of interest is a section of the river, or a specific point in the river where measurements or samples are taken.
If samples are taken, these samples are the proximate feature of interest linked directly to the Observations taken on them.

A Datastream can have multiple ultimate features of interest when its Observations are equally representative for multiple domain features.
For instance, a well can  intersect multiple aquifers in such a way that the water samples taken from this well can not be clearly assigned to one of these aquifers.
In this case, Observations on these samples have all the aquifers of the well as ultimate features of interest.

The resultType defines the result types for specialized single and multi observations based on the JSON encoding of the SWE Common Data Model (<<SweCommon>>).
The result of an Observation may be a single simple number or String, or it may contain a complex JSON structure holding multiple values for multiple ObservedProperties.
The exact definition for this result structure, and which unit of measurement and which ObservedProperty pertains to each value in the result structure is exactly described by this resultType Object.

The resultType contains references to the ObservedProperty or ObservedProperties of the Observations in the Datastream.
When a change is made to the resultType, the server MUST ensure the ObservedProperties linked to the Datastream match the references used in the the `definition` attribute(s) of the resultType, and create or remove relations as needed.
If the resultType contains references to non-existing ObservedProperties the request must be rejected with a Bad Request error.
The values of the definition attributes in the resultType must be valid entity-ids (`@id`) of ObservedProperties.
The structure of the resultType must not be changed once a Datastream has Observations, since the existing Observations would not fit the new structure.


In most cases each Observation holds a single numeric result value, measured by a single Sensor.
In this case the resultType is of the SWE-Common class `Quantity` (though a number could also be a `Count`) and thus must have the attributes `type`, `definition`, `label`, and `uom`.

- The `type` attribute defines the type of the result and has the value `Quantity`.
- The `definition` must be the same as the `definition` attribute in the single ObservedProperty linked to the Datastream.
- The `uom` attribute contains the unit of measurement and is an object that must contain either a `code` attribute with the UCUM code of the unit, or a `href` attribute with a URI pointing to a unit definition.
It may also contain the `label` and `symbol` attributes that can be displayed in user interfaces.
- The `label` attribute is somewhat redundant in this case, but since it is mandatory it can be set to the same value as the ObservedProperty `name`.

Another common type of result is a value from a key list.
An example would be an Observation of the current weather as `Fair` or `Overcast`, or the geological dating of a rock sample to be `Jurassic`.
In the latter case, the code space that defines the values could be the SWEET footnote:[https://earthportal.eu/ontologies/SWEET] ontology.
In this example the resultType is a `Category` and thus must have the attributes `type`, `definition`, `label`, and `codeSpace`.

- The `type` attribute defines the type of the result and has the value `Category`.
- The `definition` must be the same as the `definition` attribute in the single ObservedProperty linked to the Datastream.
- The `codeSpace` attribute must be a reference that defines the valid values that can be used as results.
- The `label` attribute is somewhat redundant in this case, but since it is mandatory it can be set to the same value as the ObservedProperty `name`.

In some cases, a (composite) Sensor generates multiple values that should be kept together.
This can be achieved with a `DataRecord` resultType.
In the below example, a temperature and pressure value are stored as a pair, per Observation.
The resultType has the SWE-Common class `DataRecord`, which is a composite class that contains sub-entries.
The mandatory attributes of a DataRecord are `type` and `fields`:

- The `type` attribute defines the type of the result and has the value `DataRecord`.
- The `fields` attribute is an array of other SWE-Common components.
  In this example there are two `Quantity` entries.
  Each entry has the mandatory attributes for a `Quantity`.

Since there are two _distinct_ `definition` attributes in the resultType, this Datastream must be linked to two ObservedProperties that match the two definitions.

The `resultEncoding` attribute, can be used to specify how the structure from the `resultType` attribute is encoded in the `result` attribute of the Observations.
If the `resultEncoding` is empty, or null, a JSONEncoding is used with the default configuration, as seen in the examples above.
The example below specifies a modified JSONEncoding, to mimic the result encoding of the MultiDatastream, as specified in version 1.1 of the OGC SensorThings API.

A Sensor is an entity that observes a property or phenomenon with the goal of producing an estimate of the value of the property.
A Sensor may represent a piece of hardware, but a Sensor may also be a human or an algorithm implemented in software.

A Sensor entity in an OGC SensorThings API deployment can represent either a specific sensor instance, or a more generic sensor type.
The distinction is generally quite clear from the Sensor metadata.
Does the entity have detailed metadata that is specific to a sensor instance, like a serial number and calibration data, or is it used for many Datastreams attached to many different Things.

The Sensor encodingType enables clients to know how to interpret the metadata value.
Note that the metadata attribute may contain either a URL to metadata content (e.g., an `https://`, `ftp://`, etc. link to a PDF, SensorML, or HTML document) or the metadata content itself (in the case of text/plain or other encodingTypes that can be represented as valid JSON).
It is up to clients to perform string parsing necessary to properly handle metadata content.

An Observation provides a value for an ObservedProperty of a Feature, as observed by a Sensor.
This value can be of any type, as described by the resultType of the Datastream that Observation is associated with.

TM_Object is by default encoded as a complex type with a start (mandatory) and end (optional) attributes of type TM_Instant.
This means it can either describe a time instant, when only the start is present, or a time interval with both stand and end are present.

TM_Period is by default encoded as a complex type with a start (mandatory) and end (mandatory) attributes of type TM_Instant.
This means it always describes a time interval with fixed starting and ending instants.

|====

An Observation can be directly linked to a Feature, through the relation `ProximateFeatureOfInterest`.
Features linked to an Observation in this way are generally samples, either real, physical ones.
Examples are water samples taken from a river, or the place that a moving Thing happened to be in, when it made a measurement.

In case the Feature is a domain object, such as a river, a building, or a plot of land, the Feature is indirectly linked to the Observation through the `UltimateFeaturesOfInterest` or `ProximateFeatureOfInterest` relations on the Datastream.
It is also possible for all relations to exist, in which case the `ProximateFeatureOfInterest` of the Observation is a sample of the `ProximateFeatureOfInterest` of the Datastream, which is in turn representative of the `UltimateFeaturesOfInterest`.

A third case is possible: When the target of the observation is (a sub-part of) the Thing itself.
For instance, when the Observation is on the battery-level of a drone.
In this case neither the `ProximateFeatureOfInterest` on the Observation, nor the `ProximateFeatureOfInterest` or `UltimateFeaturesOfInterest` relations on the Datastream need to be set.

====


An Observation assigns a value to a property of a subject by applying an ObservingProcedure.
The subject is the Feature that can take the role of proximate feature of interest or ultimate feature of interest of the Observation [<<OgcOMS>> and <<IsoOMS>>].
In cases where estimating the value of a property of interest is not possible directly, a proxy feature is used.
Such an application typically requires taking a sample of the ultimate feature of interest such that this sample, the proximate feature of interest, represents an approximation of the domain feature.

Some examples of features are:

- The ultimate feature of a WiFi enabled thermostat, with a built-in temperature sensor, could be the room that the thermostat monitors.
The exact position of the thermostat is captured in a Location entity of the Thing representing the thermostat.

- In the case of water quality monitoring, water samples are taken from a river at a specific sampling location.
The water sample, the sampling location, and the river are all Features.
The river Feature is attached to the Datastreams of the Observations taken on the sample through the UltimateFeaturesOfInterest relation.
The sampling location is the ProximateFeatureOfInterest attached to the Datastreams of the Observations taken on the sample.
Finally, the sample is the ProximateFeatureOfInterest directly attached to the various Observations.

- In the case of remote sensing, the Feature observed can be the individual geographical parcel or swath that is being sensed, while the Location entity captures the position of the device (drone, satellite) that hosts the sensors.
