== Scope

The OGC SensorThings API Version 2 provides an open Standard-based and geospatial-enabled framework to interconnect the Internet of Things devices, data, and applications over the web.
It defines a data model, an abstract REST API for interacting with the data model, and HTTP and MQTT protocol bindings for the REST API.
Furthermore, it provides support for push notifications for data changes over MQTT.

The data model, and the API can be extended by specifying requirements for additional protocol bindings or data encodings.
Such extensions can be added to future revisions of the Standard, or as separate extension documents.
