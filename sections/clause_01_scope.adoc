== Scope

The OGC SensorThings API Version 2 provides an open Standard-based and geospatial-enabled framework to interconnect the Internet of Things devices, data, and applications over the web.
It defines a data model, an abstract REST API for interacting with the data model, and HTTP and MQTT protocol bindings for the REST API.
The data model, and API can be extended, and additional protocol bindings can be added, by future extensions of the standard.
