=== Relation to Observations, Measurements and Samples


=== Relation to OASIS-OData

The OGC SensorThings API v2 interface is not an OData interface. It specifies a subset of the OData interface, and extends it at the same time.

An SensorThings API Server implementation can implement the full OData specification.
An OData client can access a SensorThings API service.

EDIOR: Verify this is true.
