=== Sensing Extension (Observations & Measurements)

All Sensing Extension (Observations & Measurements) requirements classes are grouped in the following requirements class:

[requirements_class]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: {identifier}/req-class/datamodel/sensing-extension-om
obligation:: requirement
subject:: Target Type: Data Model
requirement:: {identifier}/req-class/datamodel/sensing/deployment
requirement:: {identifier}/req-class/datamodel/sensing/observing-procedure

[[sensing-entities-om-extn]]
==== Sensing Extension (Observations & Measurements) Entities

The Sensing Extension (Observations & Measurements) is described by the entities in Figure {counter:figure-num}

[[deployment]]
===== Deployment

[requirements_class]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: {identifier}/req-class/datamodel/sensing/deployment
obligation:: requirement
subject:: Target Type: Data Model
requirement:: {identifier}/req/datamodel/sensing/deployment/properties
requirement:: {identifier}/req/datamodel/sensing/deployment/relations
====

A Deployment is the association of Sensors to the Thing that hosts them and produces Datastreams from the associated Sensors.
The Deployment entity is optional and the draft does not mandate defining the entity when modelling sensing applications.


[requirement]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: {identifier}/req/datamodel/sensing/deployment/properties

Each Deployment entity SHALL have the mandatory properties and MAY have the optional properties listed in Table {counter:table-num}.
====


[requirement]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: {identifier}/req/datamodel/sensing/deployment/relations

Each Deployment entity SHALL have the direct relation between a Deployment entity and other entity types listed in Table {counter:table-num}.

[width="100%",cols="5,17,3,3,3",options="header"]
|====
| *Name*
| *Definition*
| *Data Type* | *Usage*  | *Multiplicity*

| `id`
| A unique, read-only property that serves as an identifier for the entity.
Its value is computed by the server when creating or updating the entity unless specified by the client.
| ANY         | Required | One

| `name`
| A property provides a label for Deployment entity, commonly a descriptive name.
| String      | Required | One

| `description`
| The description of the Deployment entity.
| String      | Optional | Zero-to-one

| `properties`
| A JSON Object containing user-annotated properties as key-value pairs.
| JSON Object | Optional | Zero-to-one

| `position`
| The detailed description of the Sensor or system.
The metadata type is defined by encodingType
| String      | Required | One

| `time`
| The time instant or period of when the Sensors are deployed and they start producing Datastreams.
| TM_Object   | Optional | Zero-to-one

.Direct relation between a Deployment entity and other entity types
[width="100%",cols="5,5,10,10",options="header"]
|====
| *Entity Name* | *Role*      | *Multiplicity*
| *Description*

| `Sensor`      | Sensor      | Many optional to one mandatory
| Each Deployment links to one Sensor in order to maintain information regarding the relative position of the Sensor with respect to the Host (Thing), to record its deployment time and other additional infortmation.
If a sensor is redeployed on to the same Host again, the same Datastream MAY be reused but the same Deployment entity cannot be re-used.

| `Datastream`  | Datastreams | One optional to many optional
| The Deployment entity MAY be used to indicate the current state of the zero-to-many Datastreams, whether it is still open or the deployment time has expired.

| `Thing`       | Host        | Many optional to one mandatory
| Each Deployment MUST be associated with one and only one Thing.
The Thing has the role of the Host as it hosts the associated Sensors.
|====


[example%unnumbered]
====
*Deployment Examples*

- The assignment of an array of Sensors onto a platform within a Thing that monitors speed limit and driver distraction on a freeway
- The information pertaining to the orientation of moving Sensors when observing moving Features can be described by a Deployment
