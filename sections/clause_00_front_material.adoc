.Preface

[NOTE]
====
Insert Preface Text here. Give OGC specific commentary: describe the technical content, reason for document, history of the document and precursors, and plans for future work.

There are two ways to specify the Preface: "simple clause" or "full clasuse"

If the Preface does not contain subclauses, it is considered a simple preface clause. This one is entered as text after the `.Preface` label and must be placed between the AsciiDoc document attributes and the first AsciiDoc section title. It should not be give a section title of its own.

If the Preface contains subclauses, it needs to be encoded as a full preface clause. This one is recognized as a full Metanorma AsciiDoc section with te title "Preface", i.e. `== Preface`. (Simple preface content can also be encoded like full preface.)

*ISO Declaration*

ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies (ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.

International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.

The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote.

== Security Considerations

//If no security considerations have been made for this Standard, use the following text.

No security considerations have been made for this Standard.

////
If security considerations have been made for this Standard, follow the examples found in IANA or IETF documents. Please see the following example.
“VRRP is designed for a range of internetworking environments that may employ different security policies. The protocol includes several authentication methods ranging from no authentication, simple clear text passwords, and strong authentication using IP Authentication with MD5 HMAC. The details on each approach including possible attacks and recommended environments follows.
Independent of any authentication type VRRP includes a mechanism (setting TTL=255, checking on receipt) that protects against VRRP packets being injected from another remote network. This limits most vulnerabilities to local attacks.
NOTE: The security measures discussed in the following sections only provide various kinds of authentication. No confidentiality is provided at all. This should be explicitly described as outside the scope....”
