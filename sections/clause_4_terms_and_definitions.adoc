== Terms and definitions

This document uses the terms defined in OGC Policy Directive 49, which is based on the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, Rules for the structure and drafting of International Standards. In particular, the word "`shall`" (not "`must`") is the verb form used to indicate a requirement to be strictly followed to conform to this standard.

NOTE: Annex B provides guidance for implementing a STA-WebSub Hub. This guidance is not normative for this standard and therefore uses the word "`must`" to define a requirement. 

For the purposes of this document, the following additional terms and definitions apply.

=== WebSub

__WebSub (formerly PubSubHubbub) is an open protocol for distributed publishâ€“subscribe communication on the Internet.[1] Initially designed to extend the Atom (and RSS) protocols for data feeds, the protocol can be applied to any data type (e.g. HTML, text, pictures, audio, video) as long as it is accessible via HTTP. Its main purpose is to provide real-time notifications of changes, which improves upon the typical situation where a client periodically polls the feed server at some arbitrary interval. In this way, WebSub provides pushed HTTP notifications without requiring clients to spend resources on polling for change.__

__In October 2017, PubSubHubbub was renamed to WebSub for simplicity and clarity. As of January 2018, the WebSub protocol has been adopted by the W3C as a Recommendation.__
