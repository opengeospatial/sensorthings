In this section, we define each entity depicted in <<img-sta-core>> and its relationships with other entities.
Additionally, we also provide examples to model the entities in different contexts.

The SensorThings API follows the ITU-T definition, i.e., with regard to the Internet of Things, a thing is an object of the physical world (physical things) or the information world (virtual things) that is capable of being identified and integrated into communication networks [ITU-T Y.2060].
A Thing is related to the Platform entity as described in Section 4.9.2.1 of [OGC 16-079] in a way that any entity that can be modelled as a Thing MAY be subsequently translated to a Platform and vice versa.

obligation:: requirement
subject:: Target Type: Data Model
requirement:: {identifier}/req/datamodel/sensing/location/properties
requirement:: {identifier}/req/datamodel/sensing/location/relations
====

The Location entity geo-locates the Thing or the Things it associated with.
A Thingâ€™s Location entity is defined as the last known location of the Thing.

The Feature can be either a proximate feature of interest or the ultimate feature of interest depending upon the context of the Observation.
For __in-situ__ sensing applications, the Location MAY describe the coordinates of where the Thing is located.
The Feature is the entity for which the value of a property was determined by the Sensor.
The ObservedProperty in this case MAY characterize only the area around the sensing device or it MAY characterize the larger observedArea that the sensing application intends to capture.
Thus, depending upon the feature-of-interest, the Feature can then be either a ProximateFeatureOfInterest or UltimateFeatureOfInterest.
For __ex-situ__ sensing applications, the Location MAY describe the coordinates of where the Thing is located, whereas the feature MAY be the point location of the observed Feature.

EDITOR: Explain all 4 possible options? in-situ, local; in-site, remote; ex-situ, local; ex-situ, remote

Section 7.1.4 of [OGC 20-082r4 and ISO 19156:2023] provides a detailed explanation of observation location.

[example%unnumbered]
====
*Location Examples*

- An air quality sensing facility's Location can be the physical location where the facility is situated, but the (proximate) Feature that is characterized by the Observation could be the air envelope around the Sensor which is subsequently used to estimate the air quality of the district where the facility is situated.
- A drone that mounts a LiDAR Sensor may have its Location as the geo-referenced area over which the drone is scheduled to fly, whereas the Feature could be the individual objects mapped by the Sensor within that geo-referenced area

====

A Thing's HistoricalLocation entity set provides the times of the current (i.e., last known) and previous locations of the Thing.
It can be used to model the path observed by a moving Thing.

[example%unnumbered]
====
*HistoricalLocation Examples*

- A drone that measures methane leaks over a large basin may want to record the trajectory through which it flies.
HistoricalLocation should then record the individual Locations of the drone over time 

====


[requirement]

[%metadata]

Each HistoricalLocation entity SHALL have the mandatory properties and MAY have the optional properties listed in <<historical-location-properties>>.

[requirement]

[%metadata]
identifier:: {identifier}/req/datamodel/sensing/historical-location/relations

Each HistoricalLocation entity SHALL have the direct relation between a HistoricalLocation entity and other entity types listed in <<historical-location-relations>>.
====

[requirement]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: {identifier}/req/datamodel/sensing/historical-location/create-update-delete/historical-location-auto-creation

When a Thing has a new Location, a new HistoricalLocation SHALL be created and added to the Thing automatically by the service.
The current Location of the Thing SHALL only be added to this autogenerated HistoricalLocation automatically by the service, and SHALL not be created as HistoricalLocation directly by user.
====

The HistoricalLocation can also be created, updated and deleted.
One use case is to migrate historical observation data from an existing observation data management system to a SensorThings API system.
Another use case is to track the Location of a Thing, when a permanent network connection is not available.
If the Location of a Thing is changed at a later time, when a network connection is available again, then the auto-generated Time of the HistoricalLocation entity would not reflect the time when the Thing was actually at the set Location, but only the time at which the change was sent to the server.
To resolve this, the Location of a Thing can also be changed by adding a HistoricalLocation.
If the time of a manually created HistoricalLocation is later than the time of all existing HistoricalLocations, then the Location of the Thing is updated to the Location of this manually created HistoricalLocation.

[requirement]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: {identifier}/req/datamodel/sensing/historical-location/create-update-delete/historical-location-manual-creation

When a user directly adds new HistoricalLocation, and the time of this new HistoricalLocation is later than the latest HistoricalLocation for the Thing, then the Locations of the Thing are changed to the Locations of this new HistoricalLocation.

The resultType defines the result types for specialized single and multi observations based on the JSON encoding of the SWE Common Data Model [OGC 08-094r1 and OGC 17-011r2].
The result of an Observation may be a single simple number or String, or it may contain a complex JSON structure holding multiple values for multiple ObservedProperties.
The exact definition for this result structure, and which unit of measurement and which ObservedProperty pertains to each value in the result structure is exactly described by this resultType Object.

EDITOR: Ensure wording that List is not exhaustive!


The Sensor encodingType allows clients to know how to interpret the metadata value.
Currently SensorThings API defines two common Sensor metadata encodingTypes.
Most sensor manufacturers provide their sensor datasheets in a PDF format.
As a result, PDF is a Sensor encodingType supported by SensorThings API.
The second Sensor encodingType is SensorML.
Lastly, some sensor datasheets are HTML documents rather than PDFs.
Other encodingTypes are permitted (e.g., text/plain).
Note that the metadata property may contain either a URL to metadata content (e.g., an https://, ftp://, etc. link to a PDF, SensorML, or HTML document) or the metadata content itself (in the case of text/plain or other encodingTypes that can be represented as valid JSON).
It is up to clients to perform string parsing necessary to properly handle metadata content.

| The time of the Observationâ€™s result was generated

Note: Many resource-constrained sensing devices do not have a clock.
As a result, a client may omit resultTime when POST new Observations, even though resultTime is a mandatory property.
When a SensorThings service receives a POST Observations without resultTime, the service SHALL assign a null value to the resultTime.

====

An Observation assigns a value to a property of a subject by applying an ObservingProcedure.
The subject is the Feature that can take the role of ProximateFeatureOfInterest or ultimateFeatureOfInterest of the Observation [OGC 20-082r4 and ISO 19156:2023].
In cases where estimating the value of a property of interest is not possible directly, a proxy feature MAY be used.
Such an application typically requires Sampling the UltimateFeatureOfInterest such that the observed Feature represents an approximation of the domain feature.
In many sensing applications, the Observationsâ€™ Feature can be ambiguous with the Location of the Thing.
Thus the concept of roles is introduced to better describe the relationship between an Observation and it's Feature.

*Feature Examples*


- The Feature of a WiFi enabled thermostat can be the Location of the thermostat (i.e., the living room where the thermostat is located in).
However, in such cases, it is recommended to use the Location entity to store this information while the Feature entity (with the role of proximateFeatureOfInterest) can be used to model the ambient indoor atmosphere around the thermostat that approximates the overall room's temperature.

- In the case of remote sensing, the Feature observed can be the individual geographical parcel or swath that is being sensed, while the Location entity can maintain the larger geographical region that is being monitored.
