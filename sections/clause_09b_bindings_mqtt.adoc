[[mqtt-bindings]]
== MQTT Interface Bindings

The MQTT Bindings specify how to access the SensorThings API using the MQTT 5.0 protocol (<<MQTT50>>).

To help a client find the MQTT endpoints of a SensorThings service, the endpoints of the service are documented in the `+serverSettings+` object of the landing page described in <<read_service_document>>.
If the service supports the MQTT extension, then the `+serverSettings+` object SHALL contain a property of type Object, with the name

`http://www.opengis.net/spec/sensorthings/2.0/req/bindings/mqtt`

This Object SHALL contain a property named `+endpoints+` of type Array. The JSON Array `+endpoints+` SHALL hold a list of URL Schemes that can be used to connect to the MQTT service

[[mqtt-request-response]]
=== Request / Response

MQTT 5.0 formalises a request-response pattern over the MQTT protocol (<<MQTT50,section="4.10">>) that allows the use of the REST API over the MQTT protocol.
See <<mqtt5-req-res>> for a basic overview of the request-response pattern in MQTT 5.0.

MQTT 5.0 also defines User Properties (<<MQTT50,section="3.3.2.3.7">>) that can be used to pass application-defined key-value pairs with a published message.

Using the basic request-response pattern, and the User Properties of MQTT 5.0, the abstract API defined in <<abstract_api>> can be implemented over the MQTT protocol.

- Requests are sent to the topic `v2.0/$request`.
- The URL, including query parameters, for the request is passed in the User Property named `url` (case-insensitive). The URL does not need to be URL-Encoded.
- The request type (<<request_types>>) is passed in the User Property named `type`.
- Headers (such as `content-type` and `location`) are passes as User Properties.
- Content is sent as the payload of the message.
- The request must contain a response topic that follows the `Response Information` passed by the broker.
- The request may contain correlation data to help the client associate the response to the request.
- all URLs pointing to the API start with the version of the API and contain no scheme, host or port.

To minimise the size of the returned payload, by default the json format is used with `metadata=none` (<<format_json>>).

EDITOR: Check if there really is no need to URL-Encode the url.

[[mqtt-publish-subscribe]]
=== Publish / Subscribe

MQTT subscriptions are allowed on EntitySets (<<pattern_entityset>>, <<pattern_entityset_related>>), individual entities (<<pattern_entity>>, <<pattern_entity_related>>), and individual entity attributes (<<pattern_entity_property>>, <<pattern_entity_property_raw>>).

To get all updates for an EntitySet or Entity, clients can subscribe to the topic that matches the plain URL pattern, without service root, and without a preceding slash (`/`).

When an entity or attribute is created, updated/replaced or deleted, that is relevant for the subscription, the service returns a complete JSON representation of the affected entity in the payload of the message.

The action that caused the notification is specified in the user property named `type`, with a value of `create`, `update` or `delete`.
Replace actions are published with the type `update`.

User Properties:
  type: create

}

Since OData URLs are recursive, MQTT wildcards (`#` and `+`) are not allowed in subscriptions in the SensorThings topic tree.

Like HTTP URLs, MQTT topic in the SensorThings API can be extended with query options.
Query options are separated from the topic with a question mark character (`?`) and separated using an ampersant (`&`).
Query options are listed below.


==== $select

The $select query option (<<select>>) can be added to topics to reduce the amount of data that is sent.

----
v2.0/Datastreams(4)/Observations?$select=phenomenonTime,result
----


==== $expand (optional)

The $expand query option (<<expand>>) can be added to topics to indicate that certain entities related to the created or updated entity should be sent.
This can, for instance, be useful when dealing with moving sensors, to receive new Observations together with their ProximateFeatureOfInterest.

==== $filter (optional)

The $filter query option (<<filter>>) can be used to only receive notification of certain changes.


[[mqtt-simple-create]]
=== Simple Create

Since simple clients, like sensors, may not be capable of handling the full MQTT request/reponse pattern, the simple-create pattern allows for a simpler way to create entities.
Entities can be created by sending a publish request to the topic of an 
EntitySet (<<pattern_entityset>>, <<pattern_entityset_related>>), without service root, and without a preceding slash (`/`), followed by `/create`.

  "phenomenonTime": {
    "start": "2017-11-12T13:00:00Z"
  }
}
----


More advanced clients are adviced to use the MQTT Request/Response pattern to create entities, since it allows the server to return a success or failure response on entity creation.
