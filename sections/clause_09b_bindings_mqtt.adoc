== MQTT Interface Bindings

=== Introduction

The MQTT Bindings specify how to access the SensorThings API using the MQTT 5.0 protocol (<<MQTT50>>).
This binding consists of three parts that can be implemented independently: <<mqtt_request_response>>, <<mqtt_publish_subscribe>> and <<mqtt_simple_create>>.

[[mqtt_binding_advertisement]]
=== MQTT Binding Advertisement

To help a client find the MQTT endpoints of a SensorThings service, the endpoints of the service are documented in the `+serverSettings+` object of the service documents of all request-response bindings, as described in <<read_service_document>>.
If the service supports any MQTT interface bindings, then the `+serverSettings+` object SHALL contain a attribute of type Object, with the name

`{identifier}/req/binding/mqtt`

This Object SHALL contain a attribute named `+endpoints+` of type Array. The JSON Array `+endpoints+` SHALL hold a list of URL Schemes that can be used to connect to the MQTT service

.Binding Advertisement
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: {identifier}/req/binding/mqtt/advertisement

If a service implements any MQTT bindings, then the MQTT endpoints of the service SHALL be advertised in the service documents of all implemented request-response bindings, as described in <<mqtt_binding_advertisement>>.

[[mqtt_request_response]]
=== Request / Response

MQTT 5.0 formalises a request-response pattern over the MQTT protocol (<<MQTT50,section="4.10">>) that allows the use of the REST API over the MQTT protocol.
See <<mqtt5-req-res>> for a basic overview of the request-response pattern in MQTT 5.0.

MQTT 5.0 also defines User Properties (<<MQTT50,section="3.3.2.3.7">>) that can be used to pass application-defined key-value pairs with a published message.

Using the basic request-response pattern, and the User Properties of MQTT 5.0, the abstract API defined in <<abstract_api>> can be implemented over the MQTT protocol.

- Requests are sent to the topic `v2.0/$request`.
- The URL, including query parameters, for the request is passed in the User Attribute named `url`. The URL does not need to be URL-Encoded.
- The request type (<<request_types>>) is passed in the User Property named `type`.
- Request and response parameters (such as `prefer` and `location`)  are passed as User Properties.
- The status code of a response is passed in the User Attribute named 'status'.
- The content type of a message is passed in the MQTT 5 property `Content Type` (<<MQTT50, section="3.3.2.3.9">>)
- Content is sent as the payload of the message.
- The request must contain a response topic that follows the `Response Information` passed by the broker.
- The request may contain correlation data to help the client associate the response to the request.
- all URLs pointing to the API start with the version of the API and contain no scheme, host or port and no preceding slash.

To minimise the size of the returned payload, by default the json format is used with `metadata=none` (<<format_json>>) and clients are advised to use the $select query parameter.

====
[%metadata]
identifier:: {identifier}/req/binding/mqtt/request_response
inherit:: {identifier}/req-class/api/abstract

If a service advertises this requirement in the service document then the service SHALL implement the abstract API as described in <<mqtt_request_response>>.
====



[[mqtt_publish_subscribe]]
=== Publish / Subscribe

==== General


MQTT subscriptions are allowed on EntitySets (<<pattern_entityset>>, <<pattern_entityset_related>>), individual entities (<<pattern_entity>>, <<pattern_entity_related>>), and individual entity attributes (<<pattern_entity_attribute>>, <<pattern_entity_attribute_raw>>).

To get all updates for an EntitySet or Entity, clients can subscribe to the topic that matches the plain URL pattern, without service root, and without a preceding slash (`/`).

When an entity or attribute is created, updated/replaced or deleted, that is relevant for the subscription, the service returns a complete JSON representation of the affected entity in the payload of the message.

The action that caused the notification is specified in the User Property named `type`, with a value of `create`, `update` or `delete`.
Replace actions are published with the type `update`.


.Topic to use for receiving all updates for the Observations of a specific Datastream, and a typical message notifying about the creation of a new Observation

v2.0/Datastreams(4)/Observations

User Properties:
  type: create
Payload:
{
  "id": 123,
  "result": 45,
  "phenonmenonTime": "2015-02-05T17:00:00Z"
}
----


Since OData URLs are recursive, MQTT wildcards (`#` and `+`) are not allowed in subscriptions in the SensorThings topic tree.

Like HTTP URLs, MQTT topic in the SensorThings API can be extended with query options.
Query options are separated from the topic with a question mark character (`?`) and separated using an ampersant (`&`).
Query options are listed below.

requirement:: {identifier}/req/binding/mqtt/pub_sub/select
requirement:: {identifier}/req/binding/mqtt/pub_sub/expand
requirement:: {identifier}/req/binding/mqtt/pub_sub/filter

If a service advertises this requirement in the service document then the service SHALL implement the publish-subscribe API as described in <<mqtt_publish_subscribe>>.
====


[[mqtt_pubsub_select]]
==== $select

The $select query option (<<read_options_select>>) can be added to topics to reduce the amount of data that is sent.

[requirement]
.MQTT Publish / Subscribe Select
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: {identifier}/req/binding/mqtt/pub_sub/select

If a service advertises this requirement in the service document then the service SHALL implement support for the `$select` option as described in <<mqtt_pubsub_select>>.
====


[[mqtt_pubsub_expand]]
==== $expand

The $expand query option (<<read_options_expand>>) can be added to topics to indicate that certain entities related to the created or updated entity should be sent.
This can, for instance, be useful when dealing with moving sensors, to receive new Observations together with their ProximateFeatureOfInterest.

====
[%metadata]
identifier:: {identifier}/req/binding/mqtt/pub_sub/expand

If a service advertises this requirement in the service document then the service SHALL implement support for the `$expand` option as described in <<mqtt_pubsub_expand>>.
====


[[mqtt_pubsub_filter]]
==== $filter

The $filter query option (<<read_options_filter>>) can be used to only receive notification of certain changes.


[requirement]
.MQTT Publish / Subscribe Filter
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: {identifier}/req/binding/mqtt/pub_sub/filter

If a service advertises this requirement in the service document then the service SHALL implement support for the `$filter` option as described in <<mqtt_pubsub_filter>>.
====


[[mqtt_simple_create]]
=== Simple Create

Since simple clients, like sensors, may not be capable of handling the full MQTT request/reponse pattern, the simple-create pattern allows for a simpler way to create entities.
Entities can be created by sending a publish request to the topic of an 
EntitySet (<<pattern_entityset>>, <<pattern_entityset_related>>), without service root, and without a preceding slash (`/`), followed by `/create`.


.Publish message used to create an Observation in Datastream 4.
[source,text]
----
Topic: v2.0/Datastreams(4)/Observations/create
Payload:
{
  "result": 42,
  "phenomenonTime": {
    "start": "2017-11-12T13:00:00Z"
  }
}
----


More advanced clients are adviced to use the MQTT Request/Response pattern to create entities, since it allows the server to return a success or failure response on entity creation.


[requirement]
.MQTT Simple Create
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: {identifier}/req/binding/mqtt/simple_create

If a service advertises this requirement in the service document then the service SHALL implement support simple entity creation as described in <<mqtt_simple_create>>.
