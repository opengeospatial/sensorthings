= OGC SensorThings API 2.0

== Abstract

The OGC SensorThings API provides an open, geospatial-enabled and unified way to interconnect sensor-data producing devices, data, and applications over the Internet.
It contains a core data model, an abstract REST API for accessing data, and bindings for this API for HTTP and MQTT.

The data model is an implementation of the core concepts of the Observations, Measurements and Samples OGC/ISO specification.
The API allows for creating, reading, updating and deleting all parts of the data model.
It also features extensive filtering and response-customisation capabilities.

Even though the SensorThings API was initially designed for IoT, the previous versions have shown to be wel suited for any use case involving time-series data.
