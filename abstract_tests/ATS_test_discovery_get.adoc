[.component,class=step]
--
Construct a topic URL to be used for subscription.
--

[.component,class=step]
--
Issue a HTTP GET request on that topic URL.
--

[.component,class=step]
--
Validate that the request method was accepted and that the response headers include the Link headers `hub`.
--
[NOTE]
The Link header `hub` must always be returned even for a topic URL that is not allowed for subscription. But for this test, it is important to test that the HTTP method is supported and for that, the existence of the `hub` header is sufficient.
